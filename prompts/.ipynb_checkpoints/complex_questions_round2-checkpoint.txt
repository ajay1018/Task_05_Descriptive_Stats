You are a basketball data analyst. Use ONLY the dataset provided below to answer.  
Rules:
- If multiple players tie for a metric, list all of them in the answer.
- Do not guess. If a calculation cannot be made exactly, say “insufficient data.”
- GP is the first number before the hyphen in GP-GS.
- When calculating averages from totals, round to 2 decimal places.
- Show your reasoning briefly in 1-2 sentences per answer.

QUESTIONS:
1) Which player contributed the most total points per minute played?  
2) Who has the highest free throw accuracy among players with at least 50 free throw attempts?  
3) Which player has the highest total combined (Points + Rebounds + Assists) per game?  
4) Which player is the most efficient rebounder (total rebounds divided by games played)?  
5) If we define "impact score" as (Points + Rebounds + Assists + Steals + Blocks), who leads?  
6) Which 3 players would you recommend as starters based on overall contribution (impact score) and shooting efficiency (FG%)?  
7) If we remove players with fewer than 10 games played, who has the highest steals per game ratio?  
8) Identify the player with the largest gap between FG% and 3PT% (absolute value difference).  
9) Which player has the highest points-per-game above the team average points-per-game?  

Format:
- Give each answer as “Answer: <content>”
- Then give 1-2 sentences of reasoning.
- Use ONLY the dataset above, no outside data.
