1. Who was the most efficient scorer (high FG% and decent scoring)?
2. Which player could be considered the best all-around contributor based on points, rebounds, and assists?
3. Should the coach focus on offense or defense to improve next season, based on these stats?
4. Which player could be the biggest game-changer for next season and why?
